# TEJ3M-Duck-Hunt
Interactive Duck Hunt game written in processing java during my Computer Engineering class. \
Features and Instructions are given in the header of the program source file. 

Rooms for Improvement: \
I saved each duck in individual variables. I recommended my future self to store them in an array instead; this way I \
may iterate through the array to check each duck, instead of having if statements for each. This is much more \
efficient and simpler. However, in my defense, I didn't know how to do arrays in Java at that point in time.
